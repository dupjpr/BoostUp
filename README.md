## Description 

This is an application to check the behavior of the covid virus in the united states.

In the first view of the application you can see the information of the positive cases and deaths registered by the virus, for each of the states that are part of the country. At the top of the graph are the conventions for the curve of positive cases (red) and that of the number of deaths (blue). The two curves are presented in the same graph, however, you can see each one independently, activating or deactivating the curve, by clicking on the box of the convention corresponding to positive cases and the number of deaths.

If you want to see detailed information for each state, you must select the desired state from the drop-down menu. When selecting a state, a new menu will be displayed that allows you to view the information by time bands, seven days, a month or all the dates available in the database.

If the mouse pointer is placed on each bar of the graph, a tooltip is displayed with information about the total, the date and the status to which each bar or point of the graphs corresponds.

Finally, in the upper right part of the screen, in a blue box is the general information on the number of positive cases and deaths throughout the country.

To configure the project locally, use yarn.
